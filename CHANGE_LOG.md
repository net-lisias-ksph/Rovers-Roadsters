# Rovers & Roadsters :: Change Log

* 2016-0421: 0.7 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Updated for KSP 1.1.
	+ All placeholder khorsepower wheels re-configured. This is a first try at it so expect future tweaks. Wheels in KSP 1.1 area lot more difficult to configure properly now.
	+ Khorsepower output of most engines rescaled for better differentiation between pod types.
	+ Added an inline 1x05 and BoxBase battery.
	+ Fixed some hatches that were broken.
	+ All placeholder IVAs reviewed and revised, to try and reduce seat error spam in the log. If you're planning to use any of the pods in R&R from the interior... yeah, it still looks rubbish. I will get around to IVAs. Soonish.
* 2016-0217: 0.6.2 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ No changelog provided
